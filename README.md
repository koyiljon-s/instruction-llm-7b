# Instruction-Tuned Uzbek Language Model with LoRA

**Mistral-Uz-7b** is a language model fine-tuned from [Mistral 7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) on a high-quality, instruction-following dataset in the **Uzbek language**. The dataset was generated using an openai API (GPT-4o) and contains a variety of tasks (classification, summarization, question-answering, etc.) to improve model alignment with Uzbek instructions.

### Data Generation Process 
**The dataset** was generated using a self-instruct approach inspired by the Stanford Alpaca paper, and contains 23k instruction following data. The process involves generating diverse and high-quality instruction-output pairs in the Uzbek language using the [OpenAI GPT-4o API](https://openai.com)

**Instruction Format**

- `instruction`: `str`, describes the task the model should perform. Each instruction is unique.
- `input`: `str`, optional context or input for the task. For example, when the instruction is "Summarize the following article", the input is the article.
- `output`: `str`, the answer to the instruction as generated by GPT-4o


<pre> 
{
  "instruction": "Uzbek tilida maqola yozing: Sun'iy intellekt nima?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Sun’iy intellekt — bu kompyuter tizimlarining inson aqliga o‘xshash tarzda ishlash qobiliyatidir..."
}
</pre>

##  Fine-Tuning the Model

 I fine-tuned the [`mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1`](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) base model using **QLoRA** for memory-efficient training on consumer-grade hardware.

### ⚙️ Setup
- **Method**: QLoRA (8-bit quantized training with Low-Rank Adapters)
- **Hardware**: AWS `g5.xlarge` instance (1x NVIDIA A10G GPU)
- **Training Library**: `transformers`, `peft`, `trl`, `accelerate`, `bitsandbytes`
- **Dataset**: Custom-generated instruction dataset in Uzbek (Self-Instruct style)
- **Training Time**: ~ 8 hours

###  Hyperparameters

| Hyperparameter      | Value        |
|---------------------|--------------|
| Batch size          | 4            |
| Gradient accumulation | 8          |
| Epochs              | 3            |
| Learning rate       | 2e-4         |
| Max sequence length | 1024         |
